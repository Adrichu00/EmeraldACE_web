seed = 0x1234ABCD     ; Should not be 0
; The seed you write above must be:
; For wild pokemons with Sweet Scent (will always be H1): 2 cycles before your target seed
; For Rayquaza, Deoxys, Kyogre, Regirock (and probably others): 3 cycles before your target seed
; For Sudowoodo: 6 cycles before your target seed (3 + 3 for the menu navigation involved for using the Wailmer Pail)
; For Beldum (pokeball): 4 cycles before your target seed (battle must be engaged as fast as possible after closing the menu)
; For Electrode: 5 cycles before your target seed if both Electrodes are present, 4 cycles otherwise

; In general: Exiting the pokemon menu (or the bag, or the pokedex, etc) advances 3 cycles due the the ASLR.
; Additionaly, moving npc's and some other map elements will advance some cycles when closing the menu,
; and will also advance some cycles regularly (more or less) when not in a menu/animation/battle.

; Method 1 mons with NPCs in the vicinity like Wynaut egg and fossils might be less consistent as a result,
; but for those without NPCs the results are very consistent.

; As this code uses the exit code Bootstrapped,
; you have to setup the certificate exit code bootstrap before using it.

; For stationnary pokemons, once the code has been executed and that you have
; exited the menu, you should start the encounter as soon as possible to
; avoid additional rng cycles due to the map events (moving npc's, etc).

; For wild pokemons, you should use sweet scent just after executing the code,
; without exiting the menu to avoid additional cycles. For that,
; you must have a stable way of triggering ACE (for instance 0x40E9 (ENG) or 0x40ED (FRA)),
; then you should capture a new pokemon and rename it ␣ ␣ D n ’ J k l ␣ ␣
; and place it in the pc, in the slot just after your exit code bootstrap
; (it should not be the last slot of box 14).
; This will change the exit routine so that it stays in the summary page
; instead of opening the certificate. More precisely, it does the following:
; adcs r0, lr, 0
; ldrh r12, [pc], 0x44
; Doing that will prevent closing the menu and having to open it back for the sweet scent method,
; thus it avoids some additional cycles advance that might have depended on the map.
; Note that if you are using a semi-stable species such as the french 0x40ED,
; you might need to open the summary of an adjacent pokemon, go to the moves
; page, and then switch to the 0x40ED moves page to avoid a crash.

seed = 0x1234ABCD     ; Should not be 0
; The seed you write above must be:
; For wild pokemons with Sweet Scent (will always be H1): 2 cycles before your target seed
; For mass outbreaks with Sweet Scent (will always be H1): 1 cycle before your target seed
; For Rayquaza, Deoxys, Kyogre, Regirock (and probably others): 3 cycles before your target seed
; For Sudowoodo: 6 cycles before your target seed (3 + 3 for the menu navigation involved for using the Wailmer Pail)
; For Beldum (pokeball): 4 cycles before your target seed (battle must be engaged as fast as possible after closing the menu)
; For Electrode: 5 cycles before your target seed if both Electrodes are present, 4 cycles otherwise

; In general: Exiting the pokemon menu (or the bag, or the pokedex, etc) advances 3 cycles due the the ASLR.
; Additionaly, moving npc's and some other map elements will advance some cycles when closing the menu,
; and will also advance some cycles regularly (more or less) when not in a menu/animation/battle.

; Method 1 mons with NPCs in the vicinity like Wynaut egg and fossils might be less consistent as a result,
; but for those without NPCs the results are very consistent.

; Here is a tool to show the vicinity of your target seed: https://e-sh4rk.github.io/CodeGenerator/scripts/seed/

; As this code uses the exit code Bootstrapped,
; you have to setup the certificate exit code bootstrap before using it.

; For stationnary pokemons, once the code has been executed and that you have
; exited the menu, you should start the encounter as soon as possible to
; avoid additional rng cycles due to the map events (moving npc's, etc).

; For wild pokemons, you should use sweet scent just after executing the code,
; without exiting the menu to avoid additional cycles. For that,
; you must have a stable way of triggering ARM ACE (for instance 0x079D),
; then you should generate a new raw pokemon of species 0xFF, nickname it _ _ D n
; and place it in the pc, in the slot just after your exit code bootstrap.
; This will change the exit routine so that it stays in the summary page
; instead of opening the certificate. More precisely, it does the following:
; adcs r0, lr, 0
; Doing that will prevent closing the menu and having to open it back for the sweet scent method,
; thus it avoids some additional cycles advance that might have depended on the map.
; Note that you shouldn't stay too long in the summary or it will crash (exit it with B).

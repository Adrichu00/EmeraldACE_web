; Notes: this code will solve one of the possible side effects of long
; corruptions, the one that makes the game crash while in Route 119 or 123. That
; side effect is caused by the corruption of the weather cycle status and this
; code will set it to the status you desire, depending on the cycle parameter.
; On dry battery games the weather cycle is never updated: this code is useful
; to those who still want to change their weather.

;   This halfword (2 bytes) will be bitwise ORed with the flag_mask, changing
;   also those flags. Keep in mind that this value has to be 2-byte-aligned in
;   memory. Only flags within the same halfword as the target flag can be
;   modified. Your flag above doesn't need to be added (1 << (flag & 0x0F)).
;   Setting this parameter to 0 just changes the target flag

;     value = 1
;     multi_flag = 0x3F00 ; or 0x3F80

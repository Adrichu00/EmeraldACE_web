; This code can be used to generate a pokemon that contains THUMB code
; designed to store the address of the return from battle exit code routine
; in r0, thus allowing to use very short exit codes in the box names
; (only box 14 will be used by the exit code), as well as to switch
; execution mode from THUMB to ARM.
; Before using this code, you should use the code "Create Pokemon from nothing"
; in order to generate a pokemon of species 0xFF.
; Directly after, you should execute this code without changing the name of Box 14.
; The resulting pokemon will be in Box 10 Slot 19.
; You should then move this pokemon somewhere in box 14 slot 29
; Now, you will be able to use the exit code Bootstrapped.
; Note that you shouldn't change the name of Box 14, if you do you will have
; to run a code with the exit code ReturnToOverworldFull_ENG in order to reset it
; before being able to use the exit code Bootstrapped again.
; Finally, please note that you cannot use the exit code Bootstrapped
; if the code you are trying to execute modify the value of r0.
; In this case, you have to use the exit code ReturnToOverworldShort_ENG instead.

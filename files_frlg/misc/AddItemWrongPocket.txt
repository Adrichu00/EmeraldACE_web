; DISCLAIMER
;  The item slot that this code would generate is glitched and it will not be
;  deleted when tossed, given, sold... (although you will earn money). You can
;  read how to get rid of this glitched item slots in the DELETE MODE section
;  below.


; EXPLANATION
;  When the game tries to reduce the item quantity, it will look for it in the
;  correct pocket and won't be able to reduce its amount, but the effect of the
;  action (use, give, sell...) should be applied.


; IMPORTANT
;  Having at least one empty slot in the selected pocket is highly recommended.
;  (Total Key Item slots = 30; Total Ball slots = 13)
;  In other case, the item in the last slot would be overwritten. In addition,
;  the code would have a small chance of failing. If you don't see the item in
;  the selected pocket, try again.
;  More information about why at:
;    https://gist.github.com/Adrichu00/7088b5f37e4507c563e69a9933df957c#the-code


; USAGE
;  * If you want to USE the item, use Key Items Pocket.
;  * If you want to GIVE the item, use Balls Pocket.

;  Don't USE (Key Items Pocket) Berries or TMs, they probably won't work if you
;  try to use them from the wrong pocket. In addition, they can glitch out the
;  interfaces and freeze the game because their original pockets use a secondary
;  interface. However, you can GIVE (Balls Pocket) them to a mon if you want.

;  As mentioned above, when the item is used (or given) from the wrong pocket,
;  the game will try to reduce the item quantity in the correct pocket. You can
;  avoid losing that item by moving it to the PC.


; DELETE MODE
;  You can delete an item in the FIRST slot of the selected pocket by leaving
;  the last slot in that pocket EMPTY and setting delete_mode to 1. This may
;  be the only way to get rid of a slot generated with this code.

; This creates a hatchable Egg of any species, with 31 IVs in every stat in Box 9 Slot 27.
; Make sure Box 9 Slot 27 is empty beforehand.
; PID and OTID will both be 0x00000000, so Nature is always Hardy, and Ability is always 0.
; If using ability = 1, the Pokemon created in Box 9 Slot 27 won't be an Egg (at first).
; You can change Nature/Ability by combining with the Mail Glitch.
;
; After execution, move the Egg/Pokemon to Box 3 Slot 1.
;
; Choose ONE word that matches your desired Nature/Ability from this list:
; https://e-sh4rk.github.io/EmeraldACE_web/doc/naturewords.txt
;
; Activate the Glitched Mail Message, and enter the same word into the first four slots.
;
; For example, Adamant/Ability 0 would be:
; CHORES CHORES
; CHORES CHORES
;
; After entering the words, hatch the Egg.

; This creates a hatchable Egg of any species, with 31 IVs in every stat in Box 9 Slot 27.
; PID and OTID will both be 0x00000000, so Nature is always Hardy, and Ability is always 0.
; However combined with FRLG Mail Glitch you can acheive any Nature/Ability combo.
;
; You can find a list of words for each Nature/Ability here:
; https://raw.githubusercontent.com/papajefe/EmeraldACE_web/refs/heads/main/files_frlg/naturewords.txt
;
; Place the resulting Egg in Box 3 Slot 1 using the White Hand. 
; Enter the chosen words into first four slots of the glitched Mail Message.
; After entering the words, you can hatch the Egg normally.


species = 0x0199 ; Enter the species index number in hex. Default is Jirachi
